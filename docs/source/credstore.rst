Common Values for Credentials Store Extensions
==============================================

The credentials store extension is an extension introduced by the MIT krb5
library implementation of GSSAPI. It allows for finer control of creedntials
from within a GSSAPI application.
Each mechanism can define keywords to manipulate various aspects of their
credentials for storage or retrieval operations.

.. note:

   Only mechanisms that implement keywords can use them, some mechanism may
   share the same or similar keywords, but their meaning is always local to
   a specific mechanism.

The krb5 mechanism in MIT libraries
-----------------------------------

The krb5 mechanism as implemented by MIT libraries supports the credentials
store extension with a number of keywords.

client_keytab
"""""""""""""

The `client_keytab` keyword can be used in a credential store when it is used
with the :func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.acquire_cred_from` /
:func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.add_cred_from` functions, to indicate a
custom location for a keytab containing client keys.
It is not used in the context of calls used to store credentials.
The value is a string in the form **type:residual** where **type** can be any
keytab storage type understood by the implementation and **residual** is the
keytab identifier (usually something like a path). If the string is just a path
then the type is defaulted to `FILE`.

keytab
""""""

The `keytab` keyword can be used in a credential store when it is used with
the :func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.acquire_cred_from` /
:func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.add_cred_from` functions, to indicate a
custom location for a keytab containing service keys.
It is not used in the context of calls used to store credentials.
The value is a string in the form **type:residual** where **type** can be any
keytab storage type understood by the implementation and **residual** is the
keytab identifier (usually something like a path). If the string is just a path
then the type is defaulted to `FILE`.

ccache
""""""

The `ccache` keyword can be used to reference a specific credential storage.
It can be used both to indicate the source of existing credentials for the
:func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.acquire_cred_from` /
:func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.add_cred_from` functions, as well as the
destination storage for the :func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.store_cred_into`
function.
The value is a string in the form **type:residual** where type can be any
credential cache storage type understood by the implementation and
**residual** is the ccache identifier. If the string is just a path then
the type is defaulted to `FILE`. Other commonly used types are `DIR`,
`KEYRING`, `KCM`. Each type has a different format for the **residual**;
refer to the MIT krb5 documentation for more details.

rcache
""""""

The `rcache` keyword can be used to reference a custom replay cache storage.
It is used only with the :func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.acquire_cred_from` /
:func:`gssapi.raw.ext_cred_store.add_cred_from` functions for credentials used
to accept context establishments, not to initiate contexts.
The value is a string in the form **type:residual** where type can be any
replay cache storage type understood by the implementation and **residual** is
the cache identifier (usually something like a path). If the string is just a
path then the type is defaulted to `FILE`.
